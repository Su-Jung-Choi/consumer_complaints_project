# üè¶ Bank of America Consumer Complaints Data Analysis


In this personal project, I used MySQL to analyze consumer complaints data regarding Bank of America's products and services. The dataset includes complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from 2017 to 2023.

**The main objectives were to 1) analyze yearly complaint patterns, 2) identify products with the highest complaints and their corresponding common issues, and 3) assess the timeliness of the bank's responses.**

## ‚ö° Approach and Key Findings:

1. To uncover the yearly pattern of complaints, I extracted the year from the 'Date submitted' column and counted the number of complaints. Upon reviewing the data from 2017 to 2023, I observed entries starting from May 2017 and extending to August 2023. Consequently, I excluded 2017 and 2023 due to incomplete full-year data. The results below reveal an increasing pattern in the number of complaints from 2018 to 2022.
Notably, 2019 marked the year with the lowest number of complaints, which is a positive indicator. It may be worth delving into how and why the bank received fewer complaints in 2019 and considering strategies to replicate that success. Furthermore, given the significant recent increase in complaint numbers, understanding the root causes behind this increase is important.

2. In identifying the products with the highest number of complaints and their most common issues, I utilized the 'Product,' 'Sub-product,' and 'Issue' columns. I grouped them together to calculate the complaint counts. The findings reveal that the 'checking account' product, particularly associated with an issue regarding 'Managing an account,' received the highest number of complaints. Following closely is the product 'General-purpose credit card or charge card' paired with an issue related to 'Problem with a purchase shown on your statement'.

3. To assess Bank of America's responsiveness to consumer complaints, I counted the responses based on the 'Timely response?' column and calculated the corresponding percentages. The results indicate that approximately 93.77% of responses were timely, 3.84% were not timely, and the remaining 2.39% were still in progress at the time of analysis. This outcome suggests that Bank of America is effectively addressing issues with a high level of responsibility. 

- Note: The 'Timely response?' column is marked as Yes or No by the CFPB after the company provides a response. According to the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/2022-consumer-response-annual-report/), companies are expected to respond within **60 days** from the date of receiving a complaint to be considered timely. Responses received after this period are categorized as not timely.

4. Further examining the late responses, the results below reveal an increasing pattern of late responses. The year 2021 marked the peak with 1,224 late responses, showing a significant surge. Subsequently, in 2022, the number of late responses decreased by almost half, totaling 560. However, in 2023, there were already 529 recorded late responses by August, indicating a concerning trend despite the data only including information up to that point.

5. To break down the 'In Progress' complaints, they were grouped by month, and the results below show that Bank of America received 'In Progress' complaints between June and August. Considering that 60 days before September 14th is July 16th, the 'In Progress' status was filtered for complaints received between June 1st to July 15th, totaling 378. These complaints are anticipated to be labeled as late responses, suggesting that Bank of America might not show improvement in terms of timeliness in 2023 compared to 2022.
<!-- According to [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/data-use/), the data is published "after the company responds or after **15 days**, whichever comes first." -->

## Conclusion:
Through this comprehensive data exploration and analysis, we have uncovered insightful patterns. 
* Bank of America experienced its lowest number of complaints in 2019, indicating a positive trend. However, since 2018, there has been a consistent increase in the overall complaint count. 
* The product that present the most complaints and the associated issue were the 'checking account' product and the 'Managing an account' issue, respectively. 
* Bank of America has demonstrated commendable timeliness in addressing complaints, maintaining a historically low late response rate (< 1% from 2018 to 2020). However, in 2021, there was a substantial increase to 10.99%. It seems to decrease again in the following years, but more observations need to be made for 2023.
